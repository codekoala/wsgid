 * Merge branch develop into branch master

  git mg --no-ff -m 'release 0.6.0' develop

 * Create a new tag on top of branch master. Tags have a name =
    "v<version-number>" and a comment of "New release: <version-number>"

   git tag -a v0.6.0

 * Create a new tar.bz package, on top of branch master (or the new tag)
   git archive --format=tar --prefix=wsgid-<version-number>/ | bzip2 -v9 - >
   /tmp/wsgid-<version-number>.tar.bz2


 Since we merged with --no-ff a new commit was created on master we should
 merge this new commit back into develop. This way master branch will never  be ahead
